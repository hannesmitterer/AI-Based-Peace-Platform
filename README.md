## What is Euystacio Core?

Euystacio Core is a secure, auditable kernel state management system designed for AI, automation, and peace-keeping platforms. It provides real-time, cryptographically validated state tracking, input validation, and seamless integration with guardian, response, and audit systems.

## Key Features

- **Atomic State Updates:** All-or-nothing updates with rollback capability.
- **Cryptographic Integrity:** SHA-256 hashing, signature support, and checksums on all state changes.
- **Multi-layered Validation:** Structure, range, and cryptographic input validation.
- **Audit Trail:** Immutable, timestamped logs of all state changes and inputs.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Controlled API for updates, immutable read access.
- **Guardian & Response Integrations:** Real-time monitoring and automated safety protocol execution.
- **Performance:** Constant-time operations, <1ms input validation, minimal memory footprint.
- **Configurable:** Tune validation, retention, and heartbeat policies.

## Example State Variables

```python
{
    'trust': 1.0,           # System confidence (0.0–1.0)
    'harmony': 1.0,         # System balance (0.0–1.0)
    'emotion': 'Calm',      # Enum: 'Love', 'Anger', 'Calm', etc.
    'context': 'Calm',      # Enum: 'Calm', 'Tense', 'Crisis', etc.
    'safe_mode': False,     # Safety protocol active?
    'alert_level': 'normal' # Enum: 'normal', 'warning', etc.
    # ...plus timestamp, heartbeat, and more
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Validate all inputs:** Structure, range, and cryptographic signature checks.
2. **Atomic update:** Accept or reject state changes as a whole.
3. **Audit everything:** Every change is immutably logged with source and timestamp.
4. **Monitor & respond:** Guardian and response systems integrate for real-time security and safety.
