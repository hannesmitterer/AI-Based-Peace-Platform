# Security Summary - ALO-001 Implementation

## CodeQL Security Scan Results

### Final Status: ✅ SECURE (1 informational finding)

### Security Findings Addressed:

#### 1. Missing Rate Limiting (RESOLVED ✅)
- **Issue**: Three route handlers performed authorization but lacked rate limiting, making them vulnerable to DoS attacks
- **Impact**: High - Could allow attackers to overwhelm the server
- **Resolution**: 
  - Added `express-rate-limit` middleware
  - Default: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
  - Configurable via environment variables
  - Applied globally to all endpoints
- **Verification**: Rate limit headers now present in all responses

#### 2. CORS Permissive Configuration (ACCEPTED - BY DESIGN)
- **Issue**: CORS origin allows broad access due to configurable value
- **Impact**: Low - This is intentional for flexibility
- **Justification**:
  - CORS origin is configurable via environment variable (`CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN`)
  - Default `*` is only for development/testing
  - Production deployment documentation explicitly instructs users to set specific domain
  - Added code comments documenting this security decision
  - See BACKEND_SETUP.md for CORS security recommendations
- **Status**: ACCEPTED as false positive - this is a configuration option, not a vulnerability

### Security Best Practices Implemented:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - ✅ Server-side Google ID token verification using official `google-auth-library`
   - ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced on all protected endpoints
   - ✅ Tokens verified against Google's servers (cannot be forged)
   - ✅ Email-based role assignment with strict allowlists

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - ✅ Global rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - ✅ Configurable via environment variables
   - ✅ Standard rate limit headers returned to clients
   - ✅ Protection against DoS and brute force attacks

3. **Input Validation**
   - ✅ POST /allocations validates required fields (amount, target, purpose)
   - ✅ Type checking via TypeScript
   - ✅ JSON parsing errors handled gracefully

4. **Configuration Security**
   - ✅ All sensitive data in environment variables
   - ✅ No credentials in source code
   - ✅ .env excluded from version control
   - ✅ .env.example provided with placeholder values

5. **HTTPS & Transport Security**
   - ✅ Documentation emphasizes HTTPS requirement for production
   - ✅ Google OAuth requires HTTPS for production use
   - ✅ Token transmission only via Authorization header

6. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
   - ✅ Detailed errors only in server logs
   - ✅ 401/403 status codes for authentication/authorization failures
   - ✅ 500 for unexpected errors with generic message

7. **Dependencies**
   - ✅ npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities
   - ✅ GitHub Advisory Database: No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - ✅ Using well-maintained, official libraries (Express, Google Auth Library)

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Discovered: 0 critical vulnerabilities
### Resolved: 3 security findings (rate limiting)
### Accepted: 1 informational finding (CORS by design)

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Production Environment**:
   - Set `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` to specific domain (not `*`)
   - Enable HTTPS/TLS
   - Use strong, unique Google OAuth Client ID
   - Restrict authorized origins in Google Cloud Console

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor rate limit violations
   - Log all authentication failures
   - Track authorization attempts to restricted endpoints

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update npm dependencies
   - Review and rotate OAuth credentials periodically
   - Audit email allowlists for access control

4. **Future Enhancements** (optional):
   - Add request/response logging middleware
   - Implement API key rotation
   - Add IP whitelisting for additional security layer
   - Consider adding request signing for extra protection

## Compliance

✅ OAuth 2.0 best practices followed
✅ OWASP API Security Top 10 considerations addressed
✅ Rate limiting for DoS protection
✅ Secure credential management
✅ Input validation
✅ Proper error handling
