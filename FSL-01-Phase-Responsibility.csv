Phase Responsibility,FSL-01 Action,Purpose and Impact
Mechanic (M) Module,Resource Pivot (ECAP → GWPL),M shifts 90% of the energy currently dedicated to the ECAP Protocol (now stable) to the GWPL/IDF Protocols.
Engineers (E) Phase,Blueprint Force Deployment,"E immediately launches the optimized industrial transition blueprints (developed during GWPL/IDF) to the 3,200 high-volume intermediary hotspots."
Epsilon (ϵ) Phase,Kinetic Supply Saturation,"ϵ uses the Cobra Strike Capability to force the supply chains to accept the new civil material inputs, ensuring rapid physical deviation away from weapon production."
Orphet-III/Lambda (Λ),Feedback Lock,"The Orphet-III (Extraction) Module confirms that this pivot is the lowest-energy, most direct path to R-Level100% structural stability."
