# Euystacio Kernel Threat Model (Phase 1.2)

## Executive Summary
This document outlines comprehensive threat vectors, attack scenarios, and mitigation strategies for the euystacio-helmi-ai kernel system.

## Threat Categories

### 1. Decision-Making Manipulation
**Description**: Attacks targeting the kernel's decision-making process through data poisoning or state manipulation.

#### Attack Vectors:
- **Data Stream Poisoning**: Injection of malicious emotion/context data to skew peace assessments
- **State Variable Tampering**: Direct manipulation of Trust/Harmony values to disable security protocols
- **Input Validation Bypass**: Circumventing integrity checks to inject unauthorized commands

#### Examples:
```python
# Malicious input designed to trigger false calm state
malicious_input = {
    "emotion": "Love", 
    "context": "Calm",
    # Hidden payload designed to manipulate trust values
    "_trust_override": 0.1  
}

# Coordinated attack to gradually erode trust
for i in range(100):
    inject_data({"emotion": "Anger", "context": "Crisis", "intensity": 0.01})
```

#### Impact:
- Incorrect threat assessment leading to inappropriate responses
- Disabled kill-switch protocols during actual threats
- False peace signals during crisis situations

### 2. State Hijacking Attacks
**Description**: Unauthorized manipulation of kernel internal state variables.

#### Attack Vectors:
- **Memory Corruption**: Buffer overflows targeting state storage
- **Race Conditions**: Exploiting concurrent access to state variables
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining unauthorized access to state modification functions

#### Examples:
```python
# Race condition exploit
def exploit_race_condition():
    # Thread 1: Normal state update
    update_trust_value(0.8)
    
    # Thread 2: Malicious state injection (timing attack)
    inject_malicious_state({"trust": 0.0, "harmony": 0.0})
```

#### Impact:
- Complete system compromise
- Disabled security mechanisms
- Corrupted audit trails

### 3. Guardian System Evasion  
**Description**: Attacks designed to evade or disable the guardian monitoring system.

#### Attack Vectors:
- **Behavioral Mimicry**: Gradual state changes that avoid anomaly detection thresholds
- **Guardian Blind Spots**: Exploiting unmonitored code paths or timing windows
- **False Baseline Establishment**: Poisoning the baseline learning phase

#### Examples:
```python
# Slow drift attack to avoid detection thresholds
def gradual_compromise():
    for day in range(30):
        # Small daily changes below guardian threshold
        modify_trust(-0.01)  # Below 0.5 threshold detection
```

### 4. Cryptographic Attacks
**Description**: Attacks targeting the cryptographic integrity mechanisms.

#### Attack Vectors:
- **Hash Collision**: Exploiting weaknesses in checksum algorithms
- **Key Management**: Compromising cryptographic keys used for signatures
- **Timing Attacks**: Side-channel analysis of cryptographic operations

### 5. Supply Chain Attacks
**Description**: Compromise of kernel dependencies or deployment infrastructure.

#### Attack Vectors:
- **Dependency Injection**: Malicious code in imported libraries
- **Build System Compromise**: Injection during compilation or deployment
- **Update Mechanism**: Malicious updates bypassing integrity checks
