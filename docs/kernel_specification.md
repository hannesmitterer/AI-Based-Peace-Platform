# Euystacio-Helmi-AI Kernel Technical Specification

## Overview
The `euystacio-helmi-ai` kernel serves as the core decision-making component of the AI-Based Peace Platform, responsible for high-stakes peace-keeping decisions and autonomous response protocols.

## Purpose and Function (Phase 1.1)

### Primary Responsibilities
1. **Peace-Keeping Decision Engine**: Processes emotional context and situational data to make critical peace-keeping decisions
2. **Threat Assessment**: Continuously evaluates system state for potential security threats and anomalous behavior
3. **Protocol Execution**: Manages execution of critical protocols including the kill-switch mechanism when necessary
4. **State Management**: Maintains and updates core system state variables (Trust, Harmony, Emotion contexts)

### Core Architecture
- **Input Processing**: Handles emotion and context data streams with integrity validation
- **State Engine**: Maintains Trust and Harmony metrics as primary decision parameters
- **Response Protocols**: Executes appropriate responses based on threat level assessment
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains immutable log of all critical decisions and state changes

### Key State Variables
- `trust`: Float value (0.0-1.0) representing system confidence level
- `harmony`: Float value (0.0-1.0) representing system balance state  
- `emotion`: String enum ('Love', 'Anger', 'Calm', etc.) representing current emotional context
- `context`: String enum ('Calm', 'Tense', 'Crisis', etc.) representing situational context

### Critical Decision Points
1. **Kill-Switch Activation**: When Trust < 0.3 and Harmony < 0.3 simultaneously
2. **Safe Mode Trigger**: When anomalous behavior detected by guardian system
3. **Alert Generation**: When state deviations exceed baseline thresholds

### Integration Points
- **Guardian System**: Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection
- **Audit System**: Immutable logging of all kernel operations
- **Response System**: Execution of safety and security protocols
- **API Layer**: External interface for system interaction

## Security Requirements
- All inputs must be cryptographically validated
- State changes must be logged with timestamps and checksums
- Guardian monitoring must be intrinsic to kernel operation
- Failsafe mechanisms must be redundant and tamper-resistant

## Performance Requirements  
- Real-time response within 100ms for threat assessment
- 99.9% uptime requirement for peace-keeping operations
- Graceful degradation under resource constraints
